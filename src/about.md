Title: About
Category: __noindex

Hi, I'm Stephen Spencer, a Software Engineer working on
[SwiftKey](http://www.swiftkey.com) at Microsoft. I use this website
mostly as a kind of public notebook about machine learning and natural
language processing.

* I have a few code projects on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/stompchicken)
* I used to answer questions about machine learning and NLP on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/5856/stompchicken)
* I have a weird kind of a CV thing on [Stack Overflow Careers](http://stackoverflow.com/cv/stompchicken)
* I shout meaningless things into the ether on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/stompchicken)

It should go without saying that whatever is expressed on this site
does not represent the views of my employer, but unfortunately I still
have to say it.
