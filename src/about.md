Title: About
Category: __noindex

Hi, I'm Stephen Spencer, a Software Engineer working
on [SwiftKey](http://www.swiftkey.com) at Microsoft. I use this
website mostly as a kind of public notebook about programming, machine
learning and natural language processing. The title is a kind of a
reference to the pessimistic nature of machine learning.

* I have a few code projects
  on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/stompchicken)
* I used to answer questions about machine learning and NLP
  on
  [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/5856/stompchicken)
* I have a weird kind of a CV thing
  on
  [Stack Overflow Careers](http://stackoverflow.com/cv/stompchicken)
* I shout meaningless things into the ether
  on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/stompchicken)

If you want to email me then combining my first name with the domain
of this website will work.

It should go without saying that whatever is expressed on this site
does not represent the views of my employer, but unfortunately I still
have to say it.
