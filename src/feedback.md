Title: Feedback in Machine Learning
Category: Machine Learning
Summary: Beyond supervised and unsupervised

I've been thinking about feedback in machine learning after Stack Overflow reminded me of a question that I answered badly a long time ago. My basic point is that the classic distinction between 'supervised' and 'unsupervised' learning doesn't really cover all the different ways a machine learning algorithm can received feedback. I think that considering feedback is a good way to think about learning.


#### Supervised learning

You get a finite set of samples from the function of interest. Some variations can include:
 * label noise

#### Semi-supervised learning

You get a finite set of samples from the function, but another 

#### Transfer learning

You get a finite set of samples from a function that is similar to the function of interest

#### Non-stationary learning


#### Bandit learning




#### Reinforcement learning

This is bandit learning where the feedback is related to the action you take through some kind of complicated function (which you must also learn)


#### Unsupervised learning


#### Online learning
